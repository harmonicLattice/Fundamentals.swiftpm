My intention is that this should become a collection of concepts I've encountered and generated (and some of the code I've written) over the years, in pursuit of the goal of providing a musical environment suited to Just Intonation, combined with whatever new material is needed to craft a unified experience. It remains to be seen whether it is possible to create a responsive, fully-voiced musical instrument in this format.

## Overview

2023/07/27: Since this time last year I've been down a major, unrelated rabbit hole, but now feel free to continue with other things.

2023/05/23: Even deeper rabbit hole, I've discovered #ufotwitter and now have some semblance of a community with whom I can share my own experiences (beginning in 1987, or earlier, depending on what you count) and learn about the huge effort that has gone into documenting the experiences of others. This is a big deal for me, personally, but is also coming to a head publicly, so maybe I'll be able to tear myself away from the topic occasionally, going forward.

2022/12/25: I've been working my way through tutorials. Classic rabbit hole, but I do think they've improved my coding.

2022/07/21: Initially, this is merely the Swift Playgrounds App template, with a few empty folders added.
